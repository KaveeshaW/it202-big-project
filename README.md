This project visualizes data for the coronavirus and displays the weather at your current location. It is a PWA using Dexie.js, your devices geolocation (if you allow it), google charts, and material components of the web. API's are from https://pomber.github.io/covid19/timeseries.json and https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather. 

To start, please use the search screen. The search screen requires at least one country and one case (confirmed, deaths, or recovered). If you do not plot those, then you will not be able to see the table, line chart, or history screens correctly.
