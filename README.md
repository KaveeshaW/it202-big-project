This project visualizes data for the coronavirus and displays the weather at your current location. It is a PWA using Dexie.js, your devices geolocation (if you allow it), Google Charts, and Material Components for the Web. API's are from https://pomber.github.io/covid19/timeseries.json and https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather. 

To start, please use the search screen, accessed from clicking on the three lines on the top left corner of the app. The search screen requires at least one country and one case (confirmed, deaths, or recovered). If you do not plot those, then you will not be able to see the table, line chart, or history screens correctly. 

NOTE: if you want to plot the United States, the data has it as "us" so one would have to type it in like us
